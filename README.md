# cordova-plugin-password

Plugin for adding [Generic Password App Extension](https://github.com/joelastpass/generic-password-app-extension) into Cordova/PhoneGap Apps.


## Installation

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-password
```

### Supported Platforms

- none

## Properties

- Password.findLoginForUrl(succesCallback, errorCallback, url)
- Password.storeLoginForUrl(succesCallback, errorCallback, username, password, url, title, sectionTitle)

## Usage

You **do not** need to reference any JavaScript, the Cordova plugin architecture will add a Password object to your root automatically when you build.

Ensure you use the plugin after your `deviceready` event has been fired.

### Find login for url

Pass the following arguments to the `findLoginForUrl()` function, to prompt the user to authenticate via 1Password:

1. Success callback (called when a user has selected a login)
2. Failure callback (called when a user cancels the 1Password prompt or an error occurs.)
5. URL (String)*

```
Password.findLoginForUrl(succesCallback, errorCallback, url)
```

### Store login for url

Pass the following arguments to the `storeLoginForUrl()` function, to prompt the user to authenticate via 1Password:

1. Success callback (called when a user has selected a login)
2. Failure callback (called when a user cancels the 1Password prompt or an error occurs)
3. Username (String) 
4. Password (String)
5. URL (String)*
6. Title (String)
7. Section title (String)


```
Password.storeLoginForUrl(succesCallback, errorCallback, username, password, url, title, sectionTitle)
```

## *Best Practices ([see also](https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension#best-practices))

* Use the same `URL` during Registration and Login.
* Ensure your `URL` is set to your actual service so your users can easily find their logins within the main 1Password app.
* You should only ask for the login information of your own service or one specific to your app. Giving a URL for a service which you do not own or support may seriously break the customer's trust in your service/app.
* If you don't have a website for your app you should specify your bundle identifier as the `URL`, like so: `app://bundleIdentifier` (e.g. `app://com.acme.awesome-app`).
